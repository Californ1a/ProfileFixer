To use:

If you previously had Centrifuge installed, then you will need to remove it first.

Right-click Distance in Steam and go to Properties -> Installed Files -> Verify integrity of game files.

1. [Install BepInEx 5.x](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)
    * Do not use 6.0 prelease or bleeding edge.
	* Distance currently is 64-bit (x64).
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Californ1a/ProfileFixer/releases/latest)
3. Unzip it into Distance's root (right-click Distance in Steam and go to Manage -> Browse local files)
4. Run the game
5. Go to Options->Profiles and make sure the current profile is the one you want to attempt to restore (the one with `(selected)` next to it).
    * The name of the profile *must* match the name on the local leaderboards that you want to be associated with this profile. It can be renamed after.
7. On the main menu, hit `LeftCtrl + RightShift + P`
8. Follow the prompts
